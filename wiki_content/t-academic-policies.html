<h2 class="du-icon-policy">Academic Policies</h2>
<p>As reflected in our motto Caritas et Veritas, Dominican University strives to create an environment of academic rigor and integrity, coupled with a devotion to compassionate service. Embodying this commitment to Caritas et Veritas, you will find that the policies and resources available on this page are vital components in supporting your success as a member of the DU community.</p>
<h3>Online Communication Guidelines</h3>
<p>Students are expected to be respectful and civil when communicating with others online. Learning is deepest, most encompassing, and most successful when a variety of perspectives are contributed and discussed. For this reason, all perspectives and insights are welcome and valued, as long as they are presented thoughtfully, respectfully, and with sensitivity to the perspectives and experiences of others. Keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be respectful. Respect the privacy of others. Respect diversity and opinions that differ from your own. In any class, there will be people from many backgrounds, cultures, and experiences whose ideas may differ from our own. In a learning community, we must all work together to create spaces where colleagues feel safe to share opposing viewpoints, which broaden our perspective and provide opportunities for self-examination. It is inevitable that people will sometimes disagree with one another; address such disagreements using reliable evidence and thoughtful, respectful arguments.</li>
<li>In general, conduct yourself online in the same manner that you would in a face-to-face class or in any social situation.</li>
<li>When you participate in a whole-class or small-group online discussion, be aware that many people besides your instructor will see what you write.</li>
<li>In discussions, be sure to read carefully what others have posted before you respond. Bear in mind, there are often cases where other student replies are not visible before you post your own comments; this is a setting individual instructors control.</li>
<li>Refrain from using slang words or profanity, even if you sometimes use them at home, in social situations, or in your workplace.</li>
<li>Avoid using emoticons and abbreviations. Abbreviations can sometimes be used if they are otherwise known to everyone else taking the class, are specific to the subject of the class that you are in, and have already been covered by your instructor or in the textbook. (For example, an accounting class may have covered generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In that case, it is okay to use "GAAP".)</li>
<li>Avoid typing in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS as this implies that you are yelling at someone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Our goal at Dominican University is for you to have a rich and welcoming learning experience. In the design of our online learning environment, we follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h4>Requests for Accommodation</h4>
<p>If you have a disability that qualifies you for academic accommodations, please contact <a href="https://jicsweb1.dom.edu/ics/Campus_Life/Dean_of_Students_Office/Disability_Support_Services.jnz">Disability Support Services</a> to make your accommodations request. Once your eligibility has been determined, DSS will provide you with an Academic Accommodation Approval Form for you to send to your professors indicating what accommodations have been approved. The Disability Support Services Office can be visited in person or reached by email and phone:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:dss@dom.edu">dss@dom.edu</a><br>708-488-5177<br>Parmer Hall, Room 010J</p>
<h4>Instructor Notification</h4>
<p>If you have a documented disability that will require access or academic accommodations, please contact your instructor within the first two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. As stated above, students requesting academic accommodations must first register with <a href="https://jicsweb1.dom.edu/ics/Campus_Life/Dean_of_Students_Office/Disability_Support_Services.jnz" target="_blank">Disability Support Services</a>.</p>
<h3>Library Services</h3>
<p>Our Rebecca Crown library offers a variety of <a href="https://research.dom.edu/forstudents" target="_blank">services for our students</a>, many of which are available online.</p>
<h4>Library Databases</h4>
<p>There is off-campus access to our <a href="https://research.dom.edu/az.php" target="_blank">online databases</a>, many of which offer the full text of journal articles. To access a database, you will have to provide the same login credentials as you do to access your Dominican University email. There is information regarding this on the <a href="https://research.dom.edu/forstudents/libraryuse" target="_blank">Using the Library</a> page. If you find yourself stuck locating the right research, by all means be sure to reach out to a librarian!</p>
<h4>Guide to Copyright/Fair Use</h4>
<p>While copyright is often seen as a matter of greater importance to instructors than to students, that is not true! Students must also be aware of how the copyright law affects them, especially for citing materials used in research or even when posting something on social media.</p>
<p>Dominican University has a <a href="https://research.dom.edu/copyright/home" target="_blank">Copyright Policy</a> available on the library's web site. There is specific section of the policy that explains the <a href="https://research.dom.edu/copyright/students" target="_blank">Student Responsibilities and Rights</a> with respect to copyright.</p>
<p>Various sections of the policy link to additional outside resources that you may find of interest.</p>
<h3>Student Handbook</h3>
<p>Dominican University's <a href="https://jicsweb1.dom.edu/ICS/Campus_Life/Dean_of_Students_Office/Student_Handbook/" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a> is available online through the Dean of Students site. All those who enroll in the University accept the terms and conditions stated in the <a href="https://jicsweb1.dom.edu/ICS/Campus_Life/Dean_of_Students_Office/Student_Handbook/Student_Code_of_Conduct.jnz" target="_blank">Student Code of Conduct</a> and policies.</p>
<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
<p>All members of the university community have a responsibility to maintain our institutional culture of integrity. Students who cheat deprive themselves, first and foremost, of the potential for authentic learning and personal growth that led them to pursue their studies. Students are responsible for reading and following Dominican's Academic Integrity policy, which is available in both the <a href="http://bulletin.dom.edu/content.php?catoid=10&amp;navoid=1460#academic_integrity_policy" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a> as well as the <a href="http://bulletin.dom.edu/content.php?catoid=10&amp;navoid=1460" target="_blank">Academic Regulations</a> section in of the University Bulletin.</p>
<h3>University Bulletin</h3>
<p>Any Dominican University academic regulations otherwise not covered above can be found online in the Academic Regulations section of the University Bulletin. This is the best place to check for up-to-date information.</p>
<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>Your instructor will provide you with specific information on the course grading policies. However, for your reference, you can review Dominican's grading policies on the Scale of Scholarship on the Academic Regulations page of the University Bulletin.</p>
<h4>Graduate Student Regulations</h4>
<p>Graduate student regulations covering degree requirements, satisfactory progress, and more, can be found in the University Bulletin on the Academic Regulations page under the heading Graduate Student Regulations.</p>
