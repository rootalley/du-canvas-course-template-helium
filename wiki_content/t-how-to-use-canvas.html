<h2>New to Canvas?</h2>
<p>This part of your course is being offered in the Canvas learning management system. If you are new to Canvas, you will likely find it very easy to use. This <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1124">Canvas Orientation for Students</a> video will provide a brief overview of Canvas.</p>
<h3>Supported Browsers</h3>
<p>Canvas works with most current browsers. Review this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10720">list of currently supported browsers and plug-ins</a> to ensure your system in compatible with Canvas.</p>
<p>Most web browsers have the same ability to “zoom” the text to larger or smaller sizes. You can usually do this by holding down the Ctrl key (Command key on a Mac) and tapping the + or– keys on the numeric keypad.</p>

<h3>Moving Through the Lesson Modules</h3>
<p>Each lesson is organized into modules. To progress through each module, you will see Next and Previous buttons at the bottom of each screen. Click on those buttons to go through each lesson in order. You can always skip ahead to another lesson, however, by clicking the <a href="%24CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE%24/modules" data-api-endpoint="https://dominicanu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/1468292/modules" data-api-returntype="[Module]">Modules</a> menu link on the course navigation menu.</p>
<h3>There's An App for That!</h3>
<p>Canvas has free apps for both the Android and iOS operating systems that are smartphone and tablet friendly. Search for either Canvas Student or Instructure Canvas in either Google Play or the iTunes store. When setting up your account, be sure to specify Dominican University (in Illinois) as your institution.</p>
<h3>Setting Your Notifications</h3>
<p>You can be alerted to common Canvas events, such as when a new discussion is posted, when a quiz has been graded, or whenever you receive a message that your instructor has sent from the Canvas inbox. Take a look at the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1286">Canvas guide on setting your notification preferences</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Using the Inbox</h3>
<p>You can exchange messages with your instructors and classmates using the Canvas inbox. Please note that the inbox system in Canvas is a separate system from the Dominican email system. However, when you receive a message in your Canvas inbox, a notification will be forwarded to your Dominican email by default, unless you changed this behavior when you set your notification preferences. Review these instructions about <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2666">how to use the messaging capabilities of Canvas</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding Additional E-Mail Addresses</h3>
<p>In additional to your Dominican email address that was created in the system for you, you can add additional addresses where you can be notified, and can even receive notifications on your smartphone. Review the documentation for <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2894">adding additional contact methods in Canvas</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>Detailed instructions for just about every operation in Canvas can be found in the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10701">Canvas Student Guide</a>.</p>
