<p>A welcome message to your students goes here. A welcome message is an effective way to establish your instructor presence and introduce the course to your students. Suggestions for what to discuss include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A heartfelt welcome to the students.</li>
<li>The purpose of the course and its significance to the student. (Why would a student be excited to take the course?)</li>
<li>A rundown of some of the main topics of the course.</li>
<li>Information about your personal experience with the course and/or the discipline. (What excites you about teaching this course?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be yourself! It's important to present yourself in an authentic and natural manner as this is the first opportunity to engage your students with the journey ahead.</p>
<p>Consider welcoming the students using a video message like the one below. Check out the video above as an example. The presenter gives a scenario that makes the subject relevant to you as a student, inspires you to take the course, and gives you a sense for his expertise and enthusiasm for the subject.</p>

<p>Remember, your video doesn't need fancy graphics or music like this one to be effective. Just be yourself and give it a try!</p>

<h2 class="du-icon-objectives">What Will I Learn?</h2>
<p>Upon the successful completion of this course, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the different roles an accountant can play in that organization.</li>
<li>Calculate the variables included in the cost-volume-profit (CVP) model and discuss how they affect the profitability of the organization.</li>
<li>Describe the functions of job costing and activity-based costing (ABC) and demonstrate how these techniques are utilized in a managerial capacity.</li>
<li>Calculate and use standard costing information to analyze direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.</li>
<li>Use the four capital budgeting models to make appropriate investment decisions regarding capital assets.</li>
<li>Utilize differential analysis in assisting with managerial decision making with regards to make vs. buy decisions, elimination of a product or division, accepting a special order, etc.</li>
<li>Develop a master budget and discuss how the budgets are used in managing the organization.</li>
<li>Discuss capacity utilization and issues related to capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="du-icon-format">Course Format</h2>
<p>Specify the format of the class (synchronous, asynchronous, hybrid, etc) and describe that format to your students. For example:</p>
<p>This is hybrid course. We will meet on Tuesdays in Lewis 206 from 10:00–11:15 and on Thursdays from 10:00–11:15 via Zoom. (Check the Zoom menu in this course to access the Thursday sessions.) Other than these scheduled meetings, you are free to work on the course activities here in Canvas at your own convenience as long as you meet the participation requirements and deadlines associated with each assignment.</p>
<p>This format provides a great deal of freedom for students to adopt study practices that work best for them. From experience, we can say that students will, on average, devote approximately 8–10 hours per week (provide an appropriate numeric range rather than a single value) to this course. Your workload may vary somewhat from week to week and from student to student depending on prior experience, the nature of the topic being studied, and other factors.</p>
<p>Our course begins with a Start Here module that contains several introductory activities, as well as helpful policies and resources. The topics of the course are organized into weekly modules, each of which opens on Monday and concludes on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Central time.</p>
