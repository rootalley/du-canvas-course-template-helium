<div style="border-style: solid; border-color: #fcbd31; padding: 12px; margin: 20px; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;">
<p>Chronic Disease Diet Education Presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>In this assignment/simulation, you will <em>pretend</em> you are providing a diet education to a patient on a specific chronic disease, i.e. diabetes. You will be assigned a specific disease state at least 2 weeks prior to the due date. </li>
<li>You will submit a Panopto video recording in Canvas.</li>
<li>Presentation should last at least 10-15 minutes in length.</li>
<li>While providing diet education, it is helpful to write out a script to help you guide the talking points. Since this is a simulation, please start off with, 'Hello, my name is ___________. I am here today to talk about a heart healthy diet.....' </li>
<li>Please explain to your patient the reason WHY they must follow the specific diet, the relationship between diet and their chronic disease, what are the components of the diet and what foods are recommended/not recommended.</li>
<li>Please utilize the course textbook, the Academy Evidence Analysis Library, <strong>the Nutrition Care Manual</strong>, peer-reviewed journal articles, and any other pertinent sources to provide a professional overview of your chosen disease. The Nutrition Care Manual provides handouts with diet education that can help guide you. This resource can be found on the DU library website under databases.</li>
<li>Please see the rubric. </li>
